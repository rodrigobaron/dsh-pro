/**
 * Provider-anchored headline derivation, shared by the Context tab and the
 * /context popup: the best-known occupancy of the next request, the route
 * capacity it scales against, and the composition parts anchored to that
 * total (heuristic ratios, provider-anchored sum).
 *
 * The provider anchor is the OFFICIAL token-meter `contextPressure`
 * projection (read via `useProjection('contextPressure')`) — the same
 * "projectedTokens" the chat's context ring displays; the Host no longer
 * mirrors it inside `contextTimeline`. When the projection is absent (older
 * harness, or the meter is not composed), the headline falls back to the
 * newest request's provider prompt plus the heuristic surface movement since
 * it was logged, and finally to the raw heuristic total.
